        <h1>The Speed of a Wave on a string</h1>
    <div id="content">
       <p>The speed of a wave on a string depends on the tension in the string and the linear mass density (mass per unit length) of the string.
         Specifically, the speed of the wave is proportional to the square root of the tension divided by the linear mass density. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Factors Affecting Wave Speed:

    <b>Tension (F):</b>
    A higher tension in the string means the string is stretched more tightly. This increases the force that causes the string to oscillate, resulting in a faster wave speed.
    Linear Mass Density (µ):
    This is the mass of the string per unit length (mass/length). A string with a higher linear mass density is more difficult to accelerate, and therefore waves travel slower on it. 
       </br>
<b>Equation for Wave Speed:</b>
The relationship between wave speed (v), tension (F), and linear mass density (µ) is given by: 
Code

v = √(F/µ)

In simpler terms: The wave speed is proportional to the square root of the tension and inversely proportional to the square root of the linear mass density.
    </br> 
<b>Examples:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>If you increase the tension in a guitar string, the wave speed will increase, resulting in a higher pitch.</li> 

<li>If you use a string that has a higher mass (and therefore higher linear density), the wave speed will be slower, even with the same tension.</li> 
<li>In a string, the waves have a frequency and a wavelength, and these factors also affect the speed.</li></ul>

    The speed of a wave on a string depends on the linear density of the string and the tension in the string.
