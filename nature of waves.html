        <h1>NATURE OF WAVES</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p>A wave is a disturbance that propagates through a medium. There are three words in that definition that may need unpacking: disturbance, propagate, and medium.

    A disturbance, in the sense used in this definition, is a change from the current state of a measurable quantity at some location. For example…
        a change in a kinematic variable like position, velocity, or acceleration;
        a change in an intensive property like pressure, density, or temperature;
        a change in field strength like electric field strength, magnetic field strength, or gravitational field strength.
    To propagate, in the sense used in this definition, is to transmit the influence of something in a particular direction. Synonyms for propagate include spread, transmit, communicate, and broadcast. The noun form of the word is propagation.
    A medium is the substance through which a wave can propagate. Water is the medium of ocean waves. Air is the medium through which we hear sound waves. The electric and magnetic fields are the medium of light. People are the medium of a stadium wave. The Earth is the medium of seismic waves (earthquake waves). Cell membranes are the medium of nerve impulses. Transmission lines are the medium of alternating current electric power. Medium is the singuar form of the noun. Media is the plural form (although mediums is prefered by some people).

Let's list a few key examples of wave phenomena and then connect them to this definition. The first example that comes to mind when most people hear the word wave are the kinds of waves that one sees on the surface of a body of water: deep water waves in the ocean or ripples in a puddle. The most important kinds of waves for humans are the waves we use to sense the world around us: sound and light.

Imagine a calm pool. The surface is flat and smooth. Drop a rock into it. Kerploop. The surface is now disturbed. It is higher than normal in some places and lower than normal in others. The disturbed water at the point of impact disturbs the water next to it, which in turn disturbs the water next to it, which disturbs the water next to it, and so on. The disturbance spreads outward, transmits, or propagates. The medium through which this disturbance propagates is the surface of the water.

Imagine a quiet room. The air inside is still. Drop a book onto a table in that room. Thwap. The air between the book and the table is squeezed out in a fraction of a second. The air pressure in that rapidly decreasing gap rises above normal and then rebounds. The rise and fall of pressure is like the rise and fall of the surface of the pool in the previous example. The air under the book bumps the air on the edges of the book, which bumps the air next to it, which bumps the air next to it, and so on. The medium through which this disturbance propagates is the air.

Those were the easy examples. Water waves and sound waves are examples of mechanical waves — waves that propagate through a material medium. Light is not so easy to understand as a wave, which is why there are multiple sections of this book devoted to it. Still, I am going to try to describe it briefly.

Imagine a dark cavern, deep within the Earth. The electric and magnetic fields inside are relatively static and unchanging. Strike a match. Skeerach. The atoms of carbon in the wood of the matchstick combine with the atoms of oxygen in the air releasing heat. The heat agitates the atoms of the combustion products resulting in the phenomenon known as fire. The electrons bound to the rapidly vibrating atoms disturb the electric and magnetic fields in the space surrounding them. These fields are "elastic" in a sense. A wiggle in the fields in one place causes a wiggle in the fields nearby, which causes a wiggle in the fields nearby, and so on. These wiggles eventually make it to your eye, which you perceive as light. The electric and magnetic fields that fill all of space are the medium.</p>
<strong><p>Types of waves</p></strong>

<p>1. <b>Mechanical Waves:</b>
      <div class="pics">
    Transverse Waves:
    Disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include ripples on water and light waves.</p>

<p><b>Longitudinal Waves:</b>
Disturbance is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include sound waves and seismic P-waves.</p>

<p><b>Surface Waves:</b>
Combine characteristics of both transverse and longitudinal waves, traveling along the surface of a medium. Examples include ocean waves</p>
