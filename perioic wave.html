        <h1>PERIODIC WAVES</h1>
    <div id="content">
       <p>A periodic wave is a repeating wave that maintains a consistent pattern over time, characterized by a constant wavelength and frequency. These waves exhibit a clear cycle of motion that repeats itself. 
Periodic Waves | Definition & Examples
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
<ol>

    <li><b>Repetition:</b> Periodic waves are defined by their repeating pattern, meaning the same wave shape appears repeatedly.</li> 

<li><b>Constant Characteristics:</b> The key characteristics of a periodic wave, like wavelength and frequency, remain constant throughout the wave's propagation.</li> 
<li><b>Wavelength:</b> The distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in the wave pattern.</li> 
<li><b>Frequency:</b> The number of complete cycles (or repetitions) of the wave that occur in a given time period.</li> 
<li><b>Amplitude:</b> The maximum displacement of a point on the wave from its resting position.</li> 
<li><b>Period:</b> The time required for one complete cycle of the wave.</li>
