        <h1>SOUND INTENSITY</h1>
        <div id="content">
            <p>
             Sound intensity, also known as acoustic intensity, is a measure of the power carried by sound waves per unit area.
              It's an objective measure of sound magnitude, expressed in watts per square meter (W/m²).
               The SI unit of intensity is also the watt per square.
               Sound carries energy that can be used to do work to force eardrum to vibrate. 
Key aspects of sound intensity:
       <ul>
    <li><b>Definition:</b>
     Sound intensity is the sound power that passes perpendicularly through a surface divided by the area of the surface.</li> 

<b><li>Objective measure:</b> Unlike loudness, which is a subjective perception, sound intensity is a measurable quantity independent of individual hearing.</li> 
<b><li>Relationship to loudness:</b> While not directly equivalent to loudness, sound intensity is a primary factor influencing how loud a sound will be perceived.</li> 
<b><li>Units:</b> Sound intensity is measured in watts per square meter (W/m²).</li> 
<b><li>Decibels:</b> Sound intensity is often expressed in decibels (dB), which provide a logarithmic scale for representing the intensity range.</li> 
<b><li>Hearing threshold:</b> The minimum intensity that humans can hear is approximately 1 W/m², which is assigned a sound level of 0 dB.</li> 
<b><li>Pain threshold:</b> At intensities of 1 W/m², pain is typically experienced.</li></ul>
